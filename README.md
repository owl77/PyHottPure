# PyHottPure
Typing Assistant for Homotopy Type Theory


Clone the repository and start the CLI with "python -i proof.py" (python version 3 required).  This software is the analogue of PyLog for Dependent Type Theory, it is an assistant for deriving judgments (proving theorems) in dependent type theory.

See pyhott.pdf for examples.
